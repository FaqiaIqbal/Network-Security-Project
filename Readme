For the 60 second timeout:

-theoutput.csv is the file containing the subnet wise analysis of the output as given by degreaser on 1355*256 IPs (these 1355 unique subnets were extracted from the original 50k IPs. These ips are given in tarpits_sample.txt)
-packetfile.pcap is the corresponding pcap file for this particular degreaser run.
-I filtered out the original 50k IPs from the aforementioned output file and summarized the results in ResultsOfC60.txt, which contains the % of tarpits, realhosts, and other hosts in the orginal 50k.
